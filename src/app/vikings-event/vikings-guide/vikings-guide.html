                    <h3>Find Your Assignment</h3>
                    <p>Go to the <strong>Vikings Event</strong> page and look for the "Your Characters" section. Expand
                        your character to see who you need to reinforce.</p>

                    <h3>Locate & Reinforce Quickly</h3>
                    <p>The fastest way to reinforce is to go to <strong>Alliance</strong> tab in game and click
                        <strong>Power</strong>, which will show all players in the alliance sorted by power. Then after
                        clicking the <strong>Squad Help</strong>, one can immediately send reinforcement to that player.
                        That avoids the need to find a given player on the map, which is relatively hard.

                    <h3>Use Attack Joiner Heroes</h3>
                    <p>When joining rallies or reinforcing, use heroes with "Attack Joiner" skills similar to the Bear
                        event (e.g., <strong>Chenko</strong>, <strong>Amane</strong>, etc.).</p>

                    <h3>Move Troops Out of Castle</h3>
                    <p>Move all your troops out of your castle to maximize score. If you have too many
                        troops to move out completely, <strong>leave only archers</strong> in your castle for defense.
